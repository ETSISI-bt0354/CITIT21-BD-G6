Ah yes, welcome to this empty repo. Here's where the proyect for Group 6 (Hexagons are the bestagons) will go. 

Btw, if you're reading this, you're probably a member of the group. If you're not, then you're probably a teacher. 
If you're not, then you're probably a student who's looking for answers. 
If you're not, then you're probably a random person who's looking for answers.
So good luck with that.
